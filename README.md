# House-Price-Prediction
# üè† House Price Prediction Web App

This is a simple Flask web application that predicts house prices based on user input features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, presence of amenities, and more. The model uses a trained machine learning algorithm to provide price predictions.

## üöÄ Features

- User-friendly form-based interface
- Takes in 12 input parameters (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.)
- Real-time price prediction
- Responsive design with background image
- Flask backend with machine learning model integration
